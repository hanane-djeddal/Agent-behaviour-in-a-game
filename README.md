# Agent-behaviour-in-a-game
Game theory project AIOR: strategies to win a grid game

### Abstract : 
In a game where two teams (each with a certain number of players called agent) try to pass a maximum number of tiles in the grid (a tile belongs to the last team that passed by it), we implement different subsomption architectures for the agents in order to win.
